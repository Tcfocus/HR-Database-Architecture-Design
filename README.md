# HR-Database-Architecture-Design

Use PostgreSQL to design, build, and populate a database for an HR Department of a growing theoretical company. This is based off a project from Udacity's Data Architecture course.

##Business Requirement
"Tech ABC Corp saw explosive growth with a sudden appearance onto the gaming scene with its new AI-powered video game console. As a result, they have gone from a small 10 person operation to 200 employees and 5 locations in under a year. HR is having trouble keeping up with the growth since they are still maintaining employee information in a spreadsheet. While that worked for ten employees, it has become increasingly cumbersome to manage as the company expands."

##Dataset
Excel workbook consisting of 200+ records with employee information

##Process
 - Create 3 entity relationship diagrams (conceptual, logical, and physical) to design the database
 - Load the CSV into the database using DDL SQL scripts
 - Evaluate the database and find answers for specific questions using CRUD SQL commands
